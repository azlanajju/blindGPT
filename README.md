# Visually Aided Chat GPT for Digital Learning
**Winner of the Alvas Institute of Engineering College National-Level Hackathon! üèÜ**

## Introduction

Welcome to the Visually Aided Chat GPT for Digital Learning project! This project is designed to assist visually impaired individuals in their digital learning journey by providing a chat interface powered by GPT-3.5 for natural language understanding and generation. This README provides an overview of the project, how to use it, 

## Features

- **Chat Interface**: Users can interact with the chatbot using text input and receive responses in both text and audio formats.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: The chatbot not only displays responses but also reads them aloud using TTS technology, making it accessible to visually impaired users.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Conversations with the chatbot are interactive and real-time, providing a seamless learning experience.
- **OpenAI Integration**: The project utilizes the OpenAI API for natural language processing and generation.
- **Speech Recognition**: Users can also input messages by speaking, thanks to the speech recognition feature.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: Backend server for handling chat interactions and OpenAI integration.
- Express.js: Framework for building the API server.
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Frontend for the chat interface and user interaction.
- OpenAI GPT-3.5: Leveraging state-of-the-art AI for natural language understanding.
- Web Speech API: Enabling speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up your OpenAI API key in the configuration (replace `'API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual API key).
4. Start the Node.js server using `npm start`.

## Usage

1. Open the web interface in your browser.
2. Type or speak your message into the input field.
3. The chatbot will respond with both text and audio output.
4. Interact with the chatbot in real-time for a personalized learning experience.
